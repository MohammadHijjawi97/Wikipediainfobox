# Project: Automating Infobox Template Assignment in Wikipedia Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project demonstrates the automation of assigning infobox templates to Wikipedia articles using advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The code samples provided here focus on two key approaches explored in the project:

## Approaches

1. **Approach 1**: Using embeddings generated by pre-trained models (BERT, RoBERTa, and DistilBERT) combined with traditional supervised learning algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Random Forest to predict appropriate infobox templates.
   
2. **Approach 2**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) directly for classification tasks, achieving competitive accuracy in identifying infobox templates based on article content.

> **Note:**  
> These are sample codes only, provided to showcase the implementation process of both approaches.
